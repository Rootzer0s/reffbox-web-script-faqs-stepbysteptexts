      2: "Great! You'll receive 4 to 6 double-verified leads per month based on your preferred zip codes, cities, or counties. Plus, you can set a minimum price range to ensure the referrals align with your business goals. Do you specialize in working with buyers, sellers, or both?",
      3: "Perfect. Just so you know, our leads are geo-targeted, double-verified, and pre-qualified. We gather details like budget, location, timeline, and property needs before connecting them to you. What's your main zip code so I can check availability?",
      4: "Got it! We've recently launched marketing campaigns in your area and are selecting one exclusive agent to partner with. That means we won't share these leads with other realtors once you're on board. <br><br>To give you an idea, our agents see an average 20-25% closing ratio on our referrals. Of course, success depends on factors like experience and market conditions, but our numbers are among the highest in the industry. How many closings have you completed in the past 12 months?</br></br>",

      6: "I want to be transparent with you- there are no monthly, yearly, or per-lead fees, and no recurring costs of any kind when working with us. Instead, we invest in launching a marketing campaign in your selected area and create a profile to begin SEO on your behalf. To get started, there's a small one-time fee of $649, but the best part is that it's fully reimbursed after your first closing. Your initial investment will be credited back to you. Plus, for added peace of mind, we offer a six-month money-back guarantee if you don't receive any referrals. Both the reimbursement and guarantee are provided in writing. Are you available for a quick call right now to go over the details and get you set up?",
      7: "I completely understand. Most agents are cautious about upfront fees. That's why we offer the reimbursement and a 6-month guarantee. It's a risk-free way to get started. Would you be open to discussing how this works in more detail?",
      8: "We also have a $499 option with the same 6-month guarantee. This plan ensures you're covered while giving you access to top-notch leads. Would you be interested in learning more about this?",

	<button class="nav-button" onclick="showContent(this, 'Full company background', `<br><br><b><span style='color:blue;'>(Customer Name)</span></b>, just to give you a little background on our company, we are a referral platform based out of Virginia, and we're not just a referral platform — we're also a registered brokerage ourselves on the backend, and we've been in business since 2010, and we've been helping realtors grow their business with our pre-screened and double-verified referrals.<br><br> The way we actually work is that once an agent decides to move forward with our program, we start providing them with 6-8 number of referrals from our side on a monthly basis.<br><br> The best thing about our referrals is that they're only from the selected areas of the agents that they have booked while working with us. Because while working with us, we allow agents to select their own set of areas. I mean an agent has an option to select between zip codes, city names, or county names with a servicing radius starting from 10 miles, and you can expand it all the way upto 50 miles.<br><br>And basically, you know, Once an agent does that, it actually allows us to geofence your exact territory so we can start running our marketing campaigns on your behalf.<br><br> And once we start gathering prospects' information online, It's our job to do all the scrubbing for you guys to make sure that they are motivated clients. And after that we send them towards your way so you can help them close. <b>Make sense so far?</b>`)">Full company background</button>
	<button class="nav-button" onclick="showContent(this, 'Lead Generation', `<br><br>Perfect <b><span style='color:blue;'>(Customer Name)</span></b>, first of all, I'd like to clarify that you know we do not buy leads, and we do not copy and paste the leads; we generate our own leads. And Currently, we have more than 200+ lead-generating sources of our own, out of which we are generating our prospects from and mainly, you know, we categorize them into three main categories.<br><br>- First is <b>search engines</b> such as <b>Google</b>, <b>Yahoo</b>, and <b>Bing</b>. <br>- Then we have <b>social media platforms</b> such as <b>Facebook</b>, <b>Instagram</b>, <b>LinkedIn</b>, <b>Pinterest</b>, <b>YouTube</b>, and all that stuff. <br>- And last but not least, we also have our own <b>website network</b>, <b>backlinks</b>, and <b>influencers</b>.<br><br> So once we generated a prospect, we have all the key information on hand, such as their <b>budget</b>, <b>timeline</b>, <b>location</b>, <b>the type of home they're looking to buy</b>, <b>number of bedrooms</b>, <b>number of bathrooms</b>, and most importantly, their <b>contact details</b>. And <b>if they are currently under a contract with another realtor or not</b>.<br><br>`)">Lead Generation</button>
	<button class="nav-button" onclick="showContent(this, 'Double verification process', `<br><br>Once we have collected these lead's information <b><span style='color:blue;'>(Customer Name)</b></span>, unlike any other referral plateform, we do not straight away send them your way. But instead they have to go through a strong filtration process in place so we can double verify these leads and scrub them for you. <br><br><b><span style='color:blue;'>(Customer Name)</span></b> you know, initially, these leads are filtered out through an AI-based CRM system. After that, one of our ISA agents gives them a call and reverifies all the information that they have submitted to us. And they ask them additional questions such as <b>Are they a first time home buyer?</b>, <b>Has the new work ever been done on the house?</b>, <b>Are they pre-approved by the lender or not?</b>, <b>Are they already in contract with another realtor or not?</b> To make sure that these are motivated clients who are looking forward to closing the deal. <br><br>Once our ISA agents has confiremd every detail on them, they let them know that an active referral partner who is covering those areas with us will be reaching out soon to help you close this deal. And after that, we send them towards your way and then its your job to work with them. <b>Sounds good so far?</b><br><br><mark>By any chance are you available in front of your computer or a laptop screen? Can we jump onto our website so I can also show you what I'm talking about?</mar><br><br><b>If not near a Computer/Laptop:</b><br><br><mark>No worries, if it's convenient, you can pull up the website on your phone. If not we can definitely reschedule the call for later today when you are in front of a laptop or desktop. What time works best for you?</mark>`)">Double verification process</button>

So you'll be able to select the areas you want the leads from. You can also select the minimum price range of the referrals that you want to recieve from our platform. So let's just say a lead below $500,000 doesn't make sense in your area, so you can set that in, and you'll only be getting leads above that specific price point.<br><br> Last but not the least, <b><span style='color:blue;'>(Customer Name)</span></b> you can also set your preferences on what type of leads you want to work with.Either you only want to work with buyer leads, or you only want to work with listing leads, or a healthy mix of both. And once you have specified those criteria you're basically making our job easier in the filtration process, so once we are able to generate a lead for you guys that meets your exact criteria, we double verify them for you and then transfer them over to you.`)">Process</button>
	<button class="nav-button" onclick="showContent(this, 'Guide through the website', `<br><br><mark>Now, on the top header of your screen <b><span style='color:blue;'>(Customer Name)</span></b>, can you see where it says buying, selling, renting, about us, and then it says for agents, hover over that And then click on where it says how we do it. Once you are on that page please scroll down and find the heading which says connect, close, succeed - fastest growing network in north america let me know once you can see that.</mark><br><br> <b><span style='color:blue;'>(Customer Name)</span></b>, currently we have more than <b>7000+ active realtors</b> working with us across <b>US and Canada</b> right to whom we have already distributed more than <b>286,512 referrals</b> to them and their satisfaction ratio is <b>98.37 percent</b>.
<br><b><span style='color:blue;'>(Customer Name)</span></b>, talking about the high satisfaction ratio. that is mainly due to maintaining the quality of leads, instead of providing agents the random names and numbers that they may just end up cold-calling chasing and wasting their time right.
While working with us we're not promising agents that they will be getting 25, 30 leads on a monthly basis, but instead what we are saying is that you'll only be getting up to 8 referrals per month, out of which most of the realtors are at least able to convert three referrals,  if not three at least two of our referrals, while working with us on a monthly basis. And that actually shows how good quality of our referrals are.<br><br> And you know, <b><span style='color:blue;'>(Customer Name)</span></b>, the 8 number that I'm telling you about on a monthly basis is just for the starting few months once we start seeing that an agent is closing more of our referrals. we obviously will start sending more referrals towards your way, <b>sounds fair?</b><br>
<br><b>Realtor: Yes</b><br><br>
<mark>Perfect now can you just scroll down below this can you find the heading which says <b>do it yourself vs Reffzone?</b></mark>
<br><br><b><span style='color:blue;'>(Customer Name)</span></b>, you'll be able to see that we take care of all the legwork for you guys. basically saving you time in finding new clients we do all the paid advertisements we do the digital marketing we gather the information we filter these leads out and then we transfer them over to you and then it's obviously your job on the other end to get in contact with them build a healthy relationship and eventually close those deals for us.
<br><br><b><span style='color:blue;'>(Customer Name)</span></b>, <b>talking about paid advertisements if you don't mind me asking how much on average are you spending in running your own marketing campaigns per month?</b>
<br><br><b>Realtor: e.g (About $100 per month.)</b>
<br><br>You know, we do understand marketing these days is quite expensive. The main reason, why I asked you that question was because whatever areas an agent select to work with us, we do not expect agents to spend a single dollar in running their own marketing campaigns in those specific areas because you know obviously we take care of that for you and mostly we are doing SEO, PPC, paid advertisements and digital marketing to get you those motivated clients who are looking forward to close the deal.`)">Guide through the website</button>
	<button class="nav-button" onclick="showContent(this, 'CRM system', `<br><br><mark>Now can you just scroll down below this can you find the heading where it says <b>Reffzone CRM?</b></mark><br><br>

<b>So <span style='color:blue;'>(Customer Name)</span></b>, <b>if you don't mind me confirming, you are familiar using CRM systems, correct?</b><br><br> Perfect. Then you do understand, a CRM system obviously needs to exist between us so we can keep track of our leads and closing statements, right?<br> And the CRM system that we have in place for our realtors is by the name of <b>GoHighLevel</b>. The main reason, you know, why we use the GoHighLevel CRM system is that, it is an <b>AI-based CRM system</b>, which actually allows us to use a <b>round-robin lead distribution system</b>. And what that basically means is that, you know, we do not share the same lead information to multiple realtors who might be covering the same areas with us. So lead repetition with us is not a problem.
<br>Because unlike any other referral platform, we do not create competition among our own realtors. Whatever lead’s information that we'll be sending out towards your way will be exclusive for you to work with. Because what separates us from any other referral networks out there is that, you know, we do not get a bunch of realtors on board from particular areas. We limit that number as well. And at max, you know, depending upon the market response, we only get two or three realtors to work with us from particular areas. And once we have them on board, we close these areas off for any new realtor. And that helps us maintain the exclusivity of our program and to maintain the quality of our leads.<br><br><b> That makes sense to you, right?</b>
` )">CRM system</button>
	<button class="nav-button" onclick="showContent(this, 'Sample Agent profile', `<br><br><mark>Perfect. Now, <b><span style='color:blue;'>(Customer Name)</span></b>, I would like to show you the public agent profiles for our realtors. So, on our website, on the top header, on the top right corner, can you see the purple button which says <b>Get-started</b>. Can you please click on that from me?</mark>
<mark>So, once you're on the get started page can you please scroll down let me know once you can find the heading where it says <b>sample agent profile</b>(3rd heading).</mark>
<mark>I want you to click on view sample agent profile for me let me know once you can see a sample agent profile of <b>Sandra Lane.</b></mark><br>
<br>Perfect, so basically you know the main reason for showing this profile is that all these <b>7000+</b> active realtors who are currently working with us, we're also building their public agent profiles. And the main reason we build this public agent profile is that we use these profiles to run <b>search engine optimization marketing campaigns</b>.
<br><br><b>You are familiar with the term SEO, correct?</b><br>
<b>Realtor: Yes</b><br><br>
That's perfect. Then you do understand, as a result of our SEO campaigns the prospects might be reaching out to you directly as well they might be saying they got your information of the network of Reffzone and they're interested in talking doing a business transaction with you and you know while working with us right agents have been able to close a few extra referrals in this manner as well and this will be in addition to the up towards 8 number of referrals that you'll be getting from our platform as a result of our marketing campaigns.
<br><br>Initially, we allow a timeframe of <b>24 hours</b> to a realtor to reach out to the lead. And if in case, if any one of our realtors is unable to reach them out, only in those scenarios, that lead is transferred out to another realtor as well. So that way we can also ensure that each of our lead is being connected to a realtor from our platform. Because you do understand, <b><span style='color:blue;'>(Customer Name)</span></b>, we are also spending a lot of time, effort, and money in generating these prospects and we do not want them going to waste.`)">Sample Agent profile</button>
	<button class="nav-button" onclick="showContent(this, 'Customer support service', `<br><br><mark>Now one last thing I would like to show you is that you know we provide <b>365 days of customer support service</b> as well so we can maintain the quality of our leads. <br><br>Can you just scroll down all the way to the bottom for me on our website can you see where it says <b>get support</b> and find us <b>Monday to Friday 9 a.m to 6 p.m. Eastern Standard Time</b>, <b>our support email address</b>, and then their <b>number</b>. <br><br>Just scroll down all the way to the bottom. Just above the <b>disclaimer</b>, you'll be able to see where it says <b>get support</b> and <b>find us</b>. That's our support email address. And just below that, you'll be able to see their phone lines.</mark>
<br><br>So <b><span style='color:blue;'>(Customer Name)</span></b>, Lead quality is of importance here, right? If we are not sending out quality leads to the realtor out there, then no agent, will be able to close them.
So, if in case, if you receive a lead from our platform that is <br><br>- Out of the areas that you have selected to work with us,<br>-  Or a lead that was sent to you, and you are already in contact with them, <br>- Or a worst-case scenario, a lead has some kind of misinformation. <br><br>In these types of situations, an agent who is currently associated with our platform, all they have to do is just report that lead in the CRM system as a bad lead or contact our customer support department and let them know what the problem you're facing. And what our customer support department basically does is that they try to fulfill that information for the realtor. If in case, if they aren't able to do that, they also replace those leads upon the very next available prospects from your selected areas. So that way, you know, we can also ensure that each of our lead, which we are sending out is of quality. <br><br><b>Sounds good?</b>

Can you please click on the <b>Get Started</b> button again for me? Let me know once you're on the Get Started page again.

Which comes with the one time set up fee of <b>$649</b>.
